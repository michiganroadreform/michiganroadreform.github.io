&emsp;Michigan’s infrastructure has been neglected for a very long time. As many watched on their televisions back in 2014, the Flint Water Crisis demonstrated how little focus we’ve been putting toward ensuring our public works are meeting a standard beyond merely existing. However, other than the water treatment facilities in Flint, the infrastructures of Michigan hardly get any necessary attention. The roads that we drive on every day are crumbling beneath our wheels, causing massive amounts of vehicle damages and accidents all across the state. There isn’t enough of the funding that is needed to repair these issues and ensure the ability to travel or commute for work. I want to take steps toward creating awareness and demonstrating the value in repairing our roads.
<br>&emsp;Michigan was once a playground for the speedy development of travel infrastructure and the automobile industry. The home of the first generations of widespread, mass produced and trustworthy automobiles, for decades we thrived with innovation at the heart of our state. Along with that accomplishment came many accolades regarding the development of necessary automobile infrastructure. As old tribal trails had become wider to account for more people and wagons, old market routes and military roads would later become the basis for concrete construction.<a href="http://www.michiganhighways.org/history.html">[2]</a>  Among many other milestones, Detroit’s famous Woodward Ave. would become the first mile of concrete road.<a href="http://www.michiganhighways.org/historical_overview.html">[1]</a><a href="http://explorer.acpa.org/explorer/places/united-states/michigan/detroit/street/first-mile-of-concrete-pavement-woodward-avenue-detroit-mi/">[3]</a> 
<br>&emsp;Allow us to fast-forward a few years. Riots in Detroit, argued to be the heart of Michigan and the auto industry, mark the beginning of decades of decline <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-12th-street-riot">[5]</a>. In 2010, the US. Census reports that the population of Detroit is the lowest that it’s been since 1910<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/23/us/23detroit.html">[6]</a>, estimated at about 720,000 citizens. Current estimates place it closer to 660,000 citizens. <a href="http://usapopulation2018.com/population-of-detroit-2018.html">[7]</a> The dip in population drops Detroit lower than it’s previously determined minimum taxable-population <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-12th-street-riot">[5]</a>. In 2013, Detroit became the largest city in the U.S. to ever file for bankruptcy. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/detroit-files-for-bankruptcy/">[8]</a> When you extrapolate the data and consider the state-wide effects, we can begin to account for a drop in funds that are available for the state.
<br>&emsp;Something else to take into account is the effect of changing weather on pavement, and Michigan’s unique and unpredictable weather patterns. Water seeps into cracks in the pavement and erode away the dirt underneath. When it freezes during the cold seasons, the ice expands, further eroding and compacting the roadbed underneath. Once the water melts, it leaves behind a bubble underneath the concrete. After the repeated impact of cars driving on top of it can cause the pavement to eventually break away and reveal the empty hole left from the ice underneath. <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/why-michigan-is-so-prone-to-potholes-and-why-repairs-seem-ineffective">[10]</a> With the nature of Michigan’s freshwater lakes surrounding the state on almost all sides, the Lake Effect can be very prominent. <a href="http://www.miseagrant.umich.edu/lessons/lessons/by-broad-concept/earth-science/lake-effect-snow/">[11]</a> This includes heavier amounts of snow and greater snowstorms. When it snows or freezes, it’s very common to use salt to lower the freezing point of water, causing it to melt and run away. However, water infused with salt is more likely to enter a melt-freeze cycle as the temperature hovers around the new freezing point. <a href="https://www.uniquepavingmaterials.com/road-salt-cause-potholes-road-deterioration/">[12]</a> When this water starts to gather under the roads and freeze, re-melt and freeze when regular water wouldn’t, it can accelerate the deterioration of the roadbed and eventually cause potholes.
<br>&emsp;Decades of neglect and harsh conditions have demolished all aspects of our infrastructure and our roads are no exception. It wasn’t a bill that was passed that started the degradation of our roads, but rather a bill that wasn’t passed that should have protected and protected them. Michigan spends less on its roads per capita than any other state. <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/03/28/michigan-roads-rate-poorly/70608358/">[15]</a> While more are taking notice and funds increase in support of our infrastructure, we still aren’t getting nearly enough. <a href="http://www.michiganradio.org/post/unless-lawmakers-grow-michigans-roads-will-only-get-worse">[13]</a> In order to reverse the damage done to our infrastructure, it would require us to invest over $2 billion annually, with no foreseeable end date. <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/special-report/michigan-needs-4b-more-year-infrastructure-how-pay-it">[14]</a>
<br>&emsp;Bad roads can have a negative impact in several ways. The average annual repair cost for maintenance in Detroit is over twice the national average, at $865. <a href="https://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20180225/news/653811/the-price-of-potholes-bad-roads-good-news-for-tire-shops-but-millstone">[16]</a> From taking chunks out of the tires to bending or breaking the suspension, just hitting a pothole can cause an expensive amount of damage to your car. The risk of damage increases the closer your car is to the ground. <a href="https://www.yourmechanic.com/article/5-car-parts-potholes-can-damage-by-alex-leanse">[17]</a> The lower the car, the higher the risk of the lower body of the car bottoming out, hitting the exhaust system and putting holes in pipes.
<br>&emsp;Another thing to consider is the long-term profit of investing more early-on. The longer we neglect them, the faster they deteriorate in the future. Although our funds for roads are increasing, they’re still not enough to even the score with the roads that fall apart every year. According to a study done by the Transport Asset Management Council, 16.6 percent of the roads got better between the years 2014 and 2017; in the same time span, 19.9 percent got worse. The director of the Michigan Department of Transportation, Kirk Steudle, has been quoted for the following: "It means we're slowing the rate of deterioration. The projections still show that we aren't turning the curve around, they're still going to degrade, they're still going to continue to get worse. Just not as fast.”
<br>&emsp;There aren’t very many arguments against fixing the roads. It is not an ethical or moral decision, it’s something that is necessary for the well-being of the citizens of Michigan. However, the issue arises when you ask, “Who is going to pay for this?” With a rising cost now estimated at over $2 billion a year, it’s a hard question to answer. Our current Governor, Rick Snyder, has been a huge advocate for working on our roads in the past three years. <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2018/06/michigan_beyond_infrastructure_2.html">[22]</a> In March of 2015, he submitted a proposal that would raise sales tax by one percent among many other things. However, by not focusing on the issue and also using those funds for other things, it was rejected with by an overwhelming 80%. <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2018/06/michigan_beyond_infrastructure_2.html">[22]</a> 
<br>&emsp;The administration of President Trump released a plan for federal help with the goal on improving infrastructure for state and local governments earlier this year. By approving a $200 billion federal investment, the plan hopes to accelerate the spending done by states, totaling $1.5 trillion. <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2018/06/michigan_beyond_infrastructure_2.html">[22]</a>
<br>&emsp;Considering that this is an issue that impacts nearly everyone across the state, almost everyone is involved in this. However, where most people are involved as regular citizens, some are relying on the outcome of this for their livelihood. 
<br>&emsp;Many citizens would be divided. They could either rally for the roads being replace, or rally against being taxed more than they already are. It could be important to check and see where these people are from; if they’re from impoverished areas with really bad roads, they would probably opt to get those fixed. If they’re of higher tax brackets and live in clean, nice-looking areas, they might not see the important and rally against improving the infrastructure. It’s hard to draw the line anywhere, and two people in the same house might even have differing opinions.
<br>&emsp;Perhaps another perspective would be the continued success of those who have opened tire and vehicle repair shops in Michigan. Due to the massive increase in vehicular damages, business is booming. Joe Sucher from Sucher Tire Services Inc. in Metro Detroit remarks that the winter of 17-18 might be the biggest year for repair he’s seen in 30 years. <a href="https://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20180220/news/653351/potholes-are-big-business-in-metro-detroit">[20]</a> Although I doubt they would be against the road repairs, you’d have to consider the cuts to their business models if potholes and bumpy roads became a non-issue.
<br>&emsp;This November, Michigan governor elections are coming up. The seat is open, which means that the success of any of the potential candidates are in the power of the people. This is an important time, because the boiling issue of infrastructure has been a very pressing issue in Michigan since the Flint Water Crisis. This puts the candidates under a lot of pressure to deliver values that they think are important to those living in the state. The roads are communicated effectively as an issue, it could impact the decisions and campaign promises of those candidates.
<br>&emsp;Another issue might be related to people that travel in cities or other places where getting from A to B is already a confusing process. Roadwork means more detours, delays and waiting. Driving through the roadwork in places like these is a chore itself. Google Maps and other software take time to update their databases, and the signs can sometimes be missed, causing frustration especially with those in unfamiliar territory. Additionally, entire businesses might become inaccessible, causing complaints from both the owners of the establishment and the customers.
<br>&emsp;Michigan’s roads need our help. Without intervention, they will continue to crumble and cause all sorts of issues. The longer we wait to fix these problems, the worse they become and the harder they become to remedy. We need to increase funding, whether it be through taxes or an altered appropriation of funding.
